In OpenGL, [Vertex information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex) is data about the points that make up a shape, such as position, color, and texture coordinates. This data is stored efficiently in [Vertex Buffer Objects](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_Buffer_Object) (VBOs), which are sent to the GPU and organized using Vertex Array Objects (VAOs). An Index Buffer Object (IBO) can be used to specify the order in which vertices are drawn, reducing redundant data.

A vertex buffer object (VBO) is an [OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL) feature that provides methods for uploading vertex data (position, normal vector, color, etc.) to the video device for non-immediate-mode rendering. VBOs offer substantial performance gains over [immediate mode rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_(computer_graphics)) primarily because the data reside in video device memory rather than system memory and so it can be rendered directly by the video device. These are equivalent to [vertex buffers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_computer_graphics#vertex_buffer) in [Direct3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct3D).
